    abstract = {Spatial structure has been shown to promote altruistic behavior, however, it also increases the intensity of competition among relatives. Our purpose here is to develop a model in which this competition is minimized, more precisely a local increase in fecundity has a minimal competitive effect on the fitness of nearby individuals. We work with an island model in which sites are allowed to be empty, choosing our demographic rules so that in patches with higher fecundity, empty sites are filled at a higher rate. We also allow dispersal rates to evolve in response to the proportion of empty sites in the patch. Patches with different numbers of empty sites differ in frequency, in within-patch consanguinity, and in reproductive value. Using an inclusive fitness argument, we show that our model does promote altruism; indeed Hamilton's Rule is shown to hold. The only negative effect on an actor of a gift of fecundity to a patchmate turns out to be a slight decrease in reproductive value due to an increased probability of an empty site being occupied. We show that altruists are most favored in islands with an intermediate number of empty sites.}

Because the factors regulating enzyme production are poorly understood, I used a simulation model to examine how competition, nutrient availability and spatial structure affect microbial growth and enzyme synthesis. In simulations where enzyme-producing microbes competed with cheaters (who do not synthesize enzymes but take-up product), higher enzyme costs favoured cheaters, while lower rates of enzyme diffusion favoured producers. Cheaters and producers coexisted in highly organized spatial patterns at intermediate enzyme costs and diffusion rates. Simulations with varying nutrient inputs showed that nitrogen supply can limit carbon mineralization, microbial growth and enzyme production because of the nitrogen-demanding stoichiometry of enzymes (C : N = c. 3.5 : 1). These results suggest that competition from cheaters, slow diffusion and nitrogen limitation may constrain microbial foraging and the enzymatic decomposition of complex compounds in natural environments.}

  abstract = {Microbes produce many molecules that are important for their growth and development, and the consumption of these secretions by nonproducers has recently become an important paradigm in microbial social evolution. Though the production of these public goods molecules has been studied intensely, little is known of how the benefits accrued and costs incurred depend on the quantity of public good molecules produced. We focus here on the relationship between the shape of the benefit curve and cellular density with a model assuming three types of benefit functions: diminishing, accelerating, and sigmoidal (accelerating then diminishing). We classify the latter two as being synergistic and argue that sigmoidal curves are common in microbial systems. Synergistic benefit curves interact with group sizes to give very different expected evolutionary dynamics. In particular, we show that whether or not and to what extent microbes evolve to produce public goods depends strongly on group size. We show that synergy can create an ``evolutionary trap'' which can stymie the establishment and maintenance of cooperation. By allowing density dependent regulation of production (quorum sensing), we show how this trap may be avoided. We discuss the implications of our results for experimental design.}

    abstract ={Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important opportunistic pathogen that produces a variety of cell-associated and secreted virulence factors. P. aeruginosa infections are difficult to treat effectively because of the rapid emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains. In this study, we analyzed whether the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum can be used as a simple model system to analyze the virulence of P. aeruginosa strains. The virulent wild-type strain PAO1 was shown to inhibit growth of D. discoideum. Isogenic mutants deficient in the las quorum-sensing system were almost as inhibitory as the wild type, while rhl quorum-sensing mutants permitted growth of Dictyostelium cells. Therefore, in this model system, factors controlled by the rhl quorum-sensing system were found to play a central role. Among these, rhamnolipids secreted by the wild-type strain PAO1 could induce fast lysis of D. discoideum cells. By using this simple model system, we predicted that certain antibiotic-resistant mutants of P. aeruginosa should show reduced virulence. This result was confirmed in a rat model of acute pneumonia. Thus, D. discoideum could be used as a simple nonmammalian host system to assess pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa.}

While the costs of producing such products are born only by the producer, the benefits may be distributed more widely. How are external goods-producing populations stabilized against invasion by nonproducing variants that receive the benefits without paying the cost? This question parallels the classic question of altruism, but because external goods production need not be altruistic per se, a broader range of conditions may lead to the maintenance of these traits. We start from the physics of diffusion to develop an expression for the conditions that favor the production of diffusible external goods. Important variables in determining the evolutionary outcome include the diffusion coefficient of the good, the distance between individuals, and the uptake rate of the external good. These variables join the coefficient of relatedness and the cost/benefit ratio in an expanded form of Hamilton's rule that includes both selfish and altruistic paths to the evolution of external goods strategies. This expanded framework can be applied to any external goods trait, and is a useful heuristic even when it is difficult to quantify the fitness consequences of producing the good.},

    abstract = {Host manipulation is a common parasite strategy to alter host behavior in a manner to enhance parasite fitness usually by increasing the parasite's transmission to the next host. In nature, hosts often harbour multiple parasites with agreeing or conflicting interests over host manipulation. Natural selection might drive such parasites to cooperation, compromise or sabotage. Sabotage would occur, if one parasite suppresses the manipulation of another. Experimental studies on the effect of multi-parasite interactions on host manipulation are scarce, clear experimental evidence for sabotage is elusive. We tested the effect of multiple infections on host manipulation using lab bred copepods experimentally infected with the trophically transmitted tapeworm Schistocephalus solidus. This parasite is known to manipulate its host depending on its own developmental stage. Coinfecting parasites with the same aim enhanced each other's manipulation but only after reaching infectivity. If the coinfecting parasites disagree over host manipulation, the infective parasite wins this conflict: the non-infective one has no effect. The winning (i.e. infective) parasite suppresses the manipulation of its non-infective competitor. This presents conclusive experimental evidence for both cooperation in and sabotage of host manipulation and hence a proof of principal that one parasite can alter and even neutralize manipulation by another.}

However, chronically colonized CF airways represent a surprisingly complex and diverse ecosystem. The precise contributions of different microbes to patient morbidity, and in particular the importance of inter-specific interactions, remain largely unelucidated. The importance of within-species genetic and phenotypic variation has similarly received limited explicit attention. While a host of studies provide data on the microbial species recovered from patients, these are often incomparable due to differences in sampling and data reporting, or do not present the data in a way that aids our understanding of the ecosystem within each patient. This review brings together a cross-section of recent research on the CF airways and the microbes which infect them. The results presented suggest that understanding the CF lung in terms of its community and evolutionary ecology could benefit our understanding of disease progression and influence treatment regimens.}

    abstract ={Public goods cooperation abounds in nature, occurring in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans. Although previous research focused on the behavioral and ecological conditions favoring cooperation, the question of whether the molecular and regulatory properties of the public good itself can influence selection for cooperation has received little attention. Using a metapopulation model, we show that extended molecular durability of a public good—allowing multiple reuse across generations—greatly reduces selection for cheating if (and only if) the production of the public good is facultatively regulated. To test the apparent synergy between public goods durability and facultative regulation, we examined the production of iron-scavenging pyoverdin molecules by the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a cooperative behavior that is facultatively regulated in response to iron availability. We show that pyoverdin is a very durable public good and that extended durability significantly enhances fitness. Consistent with our model, we found that nonsiderophore-producing mutants (cheats) had a relative fitness advantage over siderophore producers (cooperators) when pyoverdin durability was low but not when durability was high. This was because cooperators facultatively reduced their investment in pyoverdin production when enough pyoverdin had accumulated in the media—a cost-saving strategy that minimized the ability of cheats to invade. These findings show how molecular properties of cooperative acts can shape the costs and benefits of cooperation.}

Several mechanisms have been proposed to circumvent this dilemma but all assume that actors and recipients of altruism interact during the same time period. Here, this assumption is relaxed and a model is developed where individuals express an altruistic act, which results in posthumously helping relatives living in the future. The analysis of this model suggests that kin selected benefits can then feedback on the evolution of the trait in a way that promotes altruistic helping at high rates under limited dispersal. The decoupling of kin competition and kin selected benefits results from the fact that by helping relatives living in the future, an actor is helping individuals that are not in direct competition with itself. A direct consequence is that behaviours which actors gain by reducing the common good of present and future generations can be opposed by kin selection. The present model integrates niche-constructing traits with kin selection theory and delineates demographic and ecological conditions under which altruism can be selected for; and conditions where the ‘tragedy of the commons’ can be reduced.}

    abstract = {Kin and multilevel selection theories predict that genetic structure is required for the evolution of cooperation. However, local competition among relatives can limit cooperative benefits, antagonizing the evolution of cooperation. We show that several ecological factors determine the extent to which kin competition constrains cooperative benefits. In addition, we argue that cooperative acts that expand local carrying capacity are less constrained by kin competition than other cooperative traits, and are therefore more likely to evolve. These arguments are particularly relevant to microbial cooperation, which often involves the production of public goods that promote population expansion. The challenge now is to understand how an organism's ecology influences how much cooperative groups contribute to future generations and thereby the evolution of cooperation.}

    abstract ={Altruism presents a challenge to evolutionary theory because selection should favor selfish over caring strategies. Greenbeard altruism resolves this paradox by allowing cooperators to identify individuals carrying similar alleles producing a form of genic selection. In side-blotched lizards, genetically similar but unrelated blue male morphs settle on adjacent territories and cooperate. Here we show that payoffs of cooperation depend on asymmetric costs of orange neighbors. One blue male experiences low fitness and buffers his unrelated partner from aggressive orange males despite the potential benefits of defection. We show that recognition behavior is highly heritable in nature, and we map genetic factors underlying color and self-recognition behavior of genetic similarity in both sexes. Recognition and cooperation arise from genome-wide factors based on our mapping study of the location of genes responsible for self-recognition behavior, recognition of blue color, and the color locus. Our results provide an example of greenbeard interactions in a vertebrate that are typified by cycles of greenbeard mutualism interspersed with phases of transient true altruism. Such cycles provide a mechanism encouraging the origin and stability of true altruism.}

    abstract ={In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, self-recognition and the thereby promoted aggregation of thousands of cells into protective flocs is mediated by a family of cell-surface adhesins, the flocculins (Flo). Based on this social behavior FLO genes fulfill the definition of “greenbeard” genes, which direct cooperation toward other carriers of the same gene. The process of flocculation plays an eminent role in the food industry for the production of beer and wine. However, the precise mode of flocculin-mediated surface recognition and the exact structure of cognate ligands have remained elusive. Here, we present structures of the adhesion domain of a flocculin complexed to its cognate ligands derived from yeast high-mannose oligosaccharides at resolutions up to 0.95 Å. Besides a PA14-like architecture, the Flo5A domain reveals a previously undescribed lectin fold that utilizes a unique DcisD calcium-binding motif for carbohydrate binding and that is widely spread among pro- and eukaryotes. Given the high abundance of high-mannose oligosaccharides in yeast cell walls, the Flo5A structure suggests a model for recognition, where social non-self- instead of unsocial self-interactions are favored.}

    abstract = { AbstractOur understanding of the social lives of microbes has been revolutionized over the past 20 years. It used to be assumed that bacteria and other microorganisms lived relatively independent unicellular lives, without the cooperative behaviors that have provoked so much interest in mammals, birds, and insects. However, a rapidly expanding body of research has completely overturned this idea, showing that microbes indulge in a variety of social behaviors involving complex systems of cooperation, communication, and synchronization. Work in this area has already provided some elegant experimental tests of social evolutionary theory, demonstrating the importance of factors such as relatedness, kin discrimination, competition between relatives, and enforcement of cooperation. Our aim here is to review these social behaviors, emphasizing the unique opportunities they offer for testing existing evolutionary theory as well as highlighting the novel theoretical problems that they pose. }
