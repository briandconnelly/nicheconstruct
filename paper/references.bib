    abstract = {Host manipulation is a common parasite strategy to alter host behavior in a manner to enhance parasite fitness usually by increasing the parasite's transmission to the next host. In nature, hosts often harbour multiple parasites with agreeing or conflicting interests over host manipulation. Natural selection might drive such parasites to cooperation, compromise or sabotage. Sabotage would occur, if one parasite suppresses the manipulation of another. Experimental studies on the effect of multi-parasite interactions on host manipulation are scarce, clear experimental evidence for sabotage is elusive. We tested the effect of multiple infections on host manipulation using lab bred copepods experimentally infected with the trophically transmitted tapeworm Schistocephalus solidus. This parasite is known to manipulate its host depending on its own developmental stage. Coinfecting parasites with the same aim enhanced each other's manipulation but only after reaching infectivity. If the coinfecting parasites disagree over host manipulation, the infective parasite wins this conflict: the non-infective one has no effect. The winning (i.e. infective) parasite suppresses the manipulation of its non-infective competitor. This presents conclusive experimental evidence for both cooperation in and sabotage of host manipulation and hence a proof of principal that one parasite can alter and even neutralize manipulation by another.}

    abstract ={Altruism presents a challenge to evolutionary theory because selection should favor selfish over caring strategies. Greenbeard altruism resolves this paradox by allowing cooperators to identify individuals carrying similar alleles producing a form of genic selection. In side-blotched lizards, genetically similar but unrelated blue male morphs settle on adjacent territories and cooperate. Here we show that payoffs of cooperation depend on asymmetric costs of orange neighbors. One blue male experiences low fitness and buffers his unrelated partner from aggressive orange males despite the potential benefits of defection. We show that recognition behavior is highly heritable in nature, and we map genetic factors underlying color and self-recognition behavior of genetic similarity in both sexes. Recognition and cooperation arise from genome-wide factors based on our mapping study of the location of genes responsible for self-recognition behavior, recognition of blue color, and the color locus. Our results provide an example of greenbeard interactions in a vertebrate that are typified by cycles of greenbeard mutualism interspersed with phases of transient true altruism. Such cycles provide a mechanism encouraging the origin and stability of true altruism.}

    abstract ={In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, self-recognition and the thereby promoted aggregation of thousands of cells into protective flocs is mediated by a family of cell-surface adhesins, the flocculins (Flo). Based on this social behavior FLO genes fulfill the definition of “greenbeard” genes, which direct cooperation toward other carriers of the same gene. The process of flocculation plays an eminent role in the food industry for the production of beer and wine. However, the precise mode of flocculin-mediated surface recognition and the exact structure of cognate ligands have remained elusive. Here, we present structures of the adhesion domain of a flocculin complexed to its cognate ligands derived from yeast high-mannose oligosaccharides at resolutions up to 0.95 Å. Besides a PA14-like architecture, the Flo5A domain reveals a previously undescribed lectin fold that utilizes a unique DcisD calcium-binding motif for carbohydrate binding and that is widely spread among pro- and eukaryotes. Given the high abundance of high-mannose oligosaccharides in yeast cell walls, the Flo5A structure suggests a model for recognition, where social non-self- instead of unsocial self-interactions are favored.}
