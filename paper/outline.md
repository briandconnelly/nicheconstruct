  Through their interactions, their activities, and even their mere presence, organisms change the environment for themselves and others. This "niche construction" process becomes particularly interesting when it creates evolutionary feedback, whereby selective pressures are altered in response to environmental change. Here we consider how niche construction influences the evolution of cooperation, which has been a long-standing challenge to evolutionary theory. We simulate populations of individuals that cooperatively produce a public good that permits increased growth in a stressful environment and investigate how local- and global-scale niche construction affects the ability of these populations to resist invasion by non-producing cheats. We find that niche construction profoundly impacts the evolution of cooperation by creating new opportunities for adaptation. Cooperators are able to escape subversion by cheats as long as niche construction clears these paths of adaptation. This work provides a crucial step towards understanding how evolution occurs in complex environments like those found in nature.

# Materials and Methods

We develop a computational model to observe how the evolution of public goods production is affected as populations modify and adapt to their environment. Each simulation tracks a single metapopulation composed of $N^2$ patches arranged as an $N \times N$ bounded lattice, where each patch can hold a population. The genotype of each individual in these populations is a length $L+1$ string of digits, where $L_{min} \le L \le L_{max}$. Values (alleles) in the first $L$ positions (loci) determine the individualâ€™s level of adaptation to the environment. Each of these "stress loci" is occupied by a zero or an element from the set of alleles $A = \{1, \ldots, a_{max}\}$, where $a_{max}$ is the number of possible alleles. An additional binary allele at the $(L+1)$<sup>th</sup> locus determines whether the individual is a producer (allele $1$) or a non-producer (allele $0$) of a public good. We refer to this locus as the "production locus". Using this representation, the number of unique genotypes $G$ is $2 (A + 1)^{L}$. All model parameters and their values are listed in [Table X](https://github.com/briandconnelly/nicheconstruct/blob/master/paper/table_of_parameters.md).


## Individual Fitness and Niche Construction

*Only use phenotype based NC??*

A non-zero allele from $A$ at the $i$<sup>th</sup> stress locus will improve individual fitness by $\delta$ regardless of the allelic states of other loci (i.e., there is no epistasis). For simplicity, all non-zero alleles carry the same fitness benefit. Public good production is costly, reducing individual fitness by $c$. Thus, if the allelic state of the $l$<sup>th</sup> locus in genotype $g$ is denoted $a_{g,l}$ with $a_{g,l} \in (\{0\} \cup A)$, then the fitness of an individual with genotype $g$ is:

$$
W_{g} = z + \delta \sum_{l=1}^{L} I_{A}(a_{g,l}) - a_{g,L_{max}+1} c
$$

where $z$ is a baseline fitness (the fitness of a non-adapted individual with zeros at every locus), and $I_{A}$ indicates whether the allelic state $a_{g,l}$ is non-zero ($1$) or not ($0$). If there are no stress loci ($L=0$), the fitness of a producer and non-producer is $z-c$ and $z$, respectively.


## Overview of Simulation Cycle

Simulations are run for $T$ cycles, where each cycle consists of population growth, mutation, migration, and dilution at each patch in the metapopulation. During this process, populations can alter the environment as described later. We first detail each stage of this basic cycle.


### Initialization

Metapopulations are initiated in a state that follows the onset of an environmental stress. First, populations are seeded at each patch with producer proportion $p_{0}$ and grown to density $S(p_{0})$. Stress is then introduced by subjecting the population to a bottleneck. The number of survivors with each genotype $g$ is sampled from a binomial distribution, where the number of trials is $n_g$. The probability of success is $\mu_{t}$, which represents the likelihood that a mutation occurs that enables survival. Because individuals have not yet adapted to this new stress, the allelic state is set to $0$ at each stress locus ($\forall g \in \{1, \ldots, G\}, l \in \{1, \ldots, L\}: a_{g,l} = 0$).


### Population Growth

If $p$ is the proportion of producers in a population at the beginning of a growth cycle, then that population reaches the following size during the growth phase:

$$
S(p) = S_{min} + p (S_{max} - S_{min})
$$

Therefore, a population composed entirely of non-producers reaches size $S_{min}$, while one composed entirely of producers reaches size $S_{max}$ (with $S_{max} \ge S_{min}$). The function $S(p)$ gauges the benefit of public good production, as population size increases linearly with the proportion of producers. During growth, competition occurs among the $G$ genotypes. Consider an arbitrary genotype $g$. Let $n_g$ be the number of individuals with genotype $g$, and let $W_{g}$ be the fitness of genotype $g$ (see equation [1]). The composition of genotypes after population growth is multinomial with parameters $S(p)$ and $\{\pi_1, \pi_2, \ldots, \pi_{G}\}$, where:

$$
\pi_g = \frac{n_g W_g}{\sum_{i=1}^{G} n_i W_i}
$$

Thus, $\pi_g$ is the probability that an individual in the population after growth has genotype $g$ (such that $\sum \pi_g = 1$).


### Mutation

For simplicity, we apply mutation after population growth. For every individual, allelic state changes occur independently at each stress locus with probability $\mu_{s}$, while the production locus changes allelic state with probability $\mu_{p}$. Thus, the probability that genotype $g$ mutates into genotype $g'$ is given by

$$
\tau_{g \rightarrow g'} = \mu_{s}^{H_{s}(g,~g')}(1-\mu_{s})^{\{L-H_{s}(g,~g')\}} \mu_{p}^{H_{p}(g,~g')} (1-\mu_{p})^{\{1-H_{p}(g,~g')\}}
$$

where $H_{s}(g,~g')$ and $H_{p}(g,~g')$ are the Hamming distances between genotypes $g$ and $g'$ at the stress loci and production locus, respectively. The Hamming distance is the number of loci at which allelic states differ. Because there is no inherent relationship among alleles, each of the $A + 1$ alleles is equally likely to arise via mutation at a given locus.


### Migration

Following mutation, migration occurs among populations. For each populated patch, individuals move to an adjacent patch with probability $m$. This adjacent patch is randomly chosen with uniform probability from the source patch's Moore neighborhood, which is composed of the nearest 8 patches on the lattice. Because the metapopulation lattice has boundaries, patches located on an edge have smaller neighborhoods.


### Dilution (better name for this?)

After migration, populations are thinned to allow for growth in the next cycle. Each individual, despite its genotype, survives this bottleneck with probability $d$. The number of survivors for each genotype $g$ is sampled from a binomial distribution, where the number of trials is $n_g$ and the probability of success is $d$.
