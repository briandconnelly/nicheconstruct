## Figure 1 {#fig1}

![**Adaptation, Hitchhiking, and the Evolution of Cooperation.** Curves show the average cooperator proportion among replicate populations for the duration of simulations, and shaded areas indicate 95% confidence intervals. Unless otherwise noted, parameter values are listed in [Table 1](#tables). (**A**) Without any opportunity to adapt ($L=0$), cooperation is quickly lost. (**B**) When adaptation can occur ($L=5$), but niche construction does not affect selection ($\epsilon=0$), cooperators rise in abundance by hitchhiking along with adaptions to the external environment. Nevertheless, this effect is transient, and cooperators eventually become extinct. (**C**) Niche construction enables cooperation to be maintained indefinitely. In the majority of populations, cooperation remained the dominant strategy. The trajectories of individual populations are shown in Figure 2A.](../figures/Figure1.png)

## Figure 2 {#fig2}

![**Niche Construction and the Evolution of Cooperation.** The proportion of cooperators present in each replicate population is shown for the duration of simulations. (**A**) Despite some oscillations, cooperation dominates in 13 of 18 populations when niche construction affects selection. (**B**) When the selective effects of niche construction ($\epsilon$) are removed, and the selective benefit of adaptation to the external environment ($\delta$) is increased to compensate, cooperators are driven to extinction by isogenic defectors that arise by mutation ($\epsilon=0$, $\delta=0.6$). Note that cooperation was not present after initialization in one replicate population. (**C**) Cooperators are also driven to extinction without negative niche construction ($A=5$).](../figures/Figure2.png)

## Figure 3 {#fig3}

![**Niche Construction and Invasion.** Curves trace the proportion of cooperators present in each replicate population for the duration of simulations ($T=1000$). In each simulation, a rare type was initiated at a single patch in the center of the population lattice ($N^{2}=121$). Unless otherwise noted, mutations are disabled in these ecological simulations to highlight the dynamics of invasion ($\mu_{a}=0, \mu_{c}=0$). (**A**) When cooperators and defectors are isogenic (i.e., both types have stress alleles [1,2,3,4,5]), rare defectors quickly invade and drive cooperators to extinction due to the cost of cooperation. Defectors were stochastically eliminated in 2 replicate populations. (**B**) However, negative niche construction creates adaptive opportunities that enable cooperators to resist invasion by isogenic defectors. Here, cooperation remained the dominant in 91 of 160 populations ($\mu_{a}=0.00005$). Results from simulations where mutations also occurred at the cooperaiton locus are shown in Figure S1. (**C**) In fact, an adapted cooperator type (stress alleles [6,2,3,4,5], see Box 1) can swiftly displace defectors when isogenic defectors cannot arise or adapt via mutation.](../figures/Figure3.png)

## Figure 4 {#fig4}

![**Cooperator Adaptation Prevents Defector Invasion.** Here we depict the distribution of dominant types among subpopulations over time for one representative simulation in which isogenic defectors arise. To highlight the effects of adaptation, mutations did not occur at the cooperation locus ($\mu_{c}=0$). At time $t=0$ (upper left panel), a single isogenic defector population (red) is placed among cooperator populations (light blue). Because these defectors do not bear the costs of cooperation, they spread ($t=272$). However, cooperators in one population gain an adaptation that gives them a fitness advantage over defectors (second panel, dark blue, lower left). At $t=325$, defectors continue to invade cooperator populations. However, the adapted cooperator type spreads more quickly due to its fitness advantage, invading both defector populations and ancestral cooperator populations ($t=390$), until it eventually fixes in the population ($t=500$). At $t=690$, a new cooperator type emerges that is favored due to negative niche construction (orange). This new type spreads rapidly ($t=812$) until reaching fixation ($t=900$). At this point, it becomes susceptible to invasion by the next "adapted" cooperator type, and the cycle continues.](../figures/Figure4.pdf)

![**Defector Invasion with Mutations.** The proportion of cooperators present in each replicate population is shown for the duration of simulations ($T=1000$). When mutations occur both at the adaptive loci and the cooperation locus ($\mu_{a}=\mu{c}=0.00005$), cooperation remains dominant in 58 of 160 replicate populations.](../figures/FigureS1.png)
