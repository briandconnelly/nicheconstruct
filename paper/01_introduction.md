# Introduction

Cooperative behaviors are common across all branches of the tree of life. Insects divide labor within their colonies, plants and soil bacteria exchange essential nutrients, birds care for others' young, and the trillions of cells in the human body restrain their growth and coordinate to provide vital functions. Each instance of cooperation presents an evolutionary challenge: How can individuals that sacrifice their own well-being to help others avoid subversion by those that do not? Over time, we would expect these *defectors* to rise in abundance at the expense of others, eventually driving cooperators---and perhaps the entire population---to extinction.

Several factors can prevent this *tragedy of the commons* [@hardin1968tragedy; @hamilton1964geneticalboth; @nowak2006five; @west2007evolutionary]. For example, cooperators must benefit more from the cooperative act than others. One important factor involves non-random social interaction, in which cooperators benefit more from the cooperative act than defectors. This can occur when cooperators are clustered together in spatially-structured populations [@kudzalfick2011high; @fletcher2009simple; @nadell2010emergence] or when cooperators use communication [@darch2012density; @brown2001cooperation] or other cues [@gardner2010greenbeards; @sinervo2006selfrecognition; @veelders2010structural] to cooperate conditionally with kin. Cooperation can also be bolstered by pleiotropic connections to personal benefits [@dandekar2012bacterial; @foster2004pleiotropy] or alleles encoding self-benefitting traits [@asfahl2015nonsocial]. In the latter case, the alleles may provide (private) benefits that are completely independent from the (public) benefits of cooperation. In a population of both cooperators and defectors, this sets the stage for an "adaptive race" in which both types vie for the first highly beneficial adaptation [@waite2012adaptation; @morgan2012selection]. The tragedy of the commons can be deferred if a cooperator, by chance, wins the adaptive race.

@HANKSHAW recently showed that in spatially structured populations, cooperators can gain a substantial leg up on defectors in an adaptive race. Specifically, cooperation increases local population density, thus increasing the likelihood of acquiring beneficial mutations. By hitchhiking along with these adaptations, the cooperative trait can rapidly rise in abundance. Nevertheless, this advantage is fleeting. As soon as the opportunities for adaptation are exhausted, cooperators are once again at a disadvantage against defectors. However, @HANKSHAW demonstrated that cooperation can be maintained indefinitely when frequent environmental changes produce a steady stream of adaptive opportunities. Although organisms typically find themselves in dynamic environments, change might not occur at a rate that provides sufficient adaptive opportunities to ensure long-term cooperator persistence.

In this work, we explore whether cooperation can be maintained indefinitely by niche construction.
We expand upon the model presented in @HANKSHAW to allow populations to alter their local environment.
As environments change, so too does selection, which creates an eco-evolutionary feedback whereby selection is dependent on the genotypes present in the population, and the composition of genotypes is dependent on selection.
Niche construction can be positive or negative, depending on whether the environmental change increases or decreases the fitness of the niche-constructing individual.
We investigate whether these selective feedbacks can act as a continual source of adaptive opportunities for cooperators. 

Although niche construction occurs independently of cooperation in our model, the increase in density that results from cooperation has a profound effect on how populations evolve in the presence of selective feedbacks.
First, these populations exert greater influence on their environments, which better enables them to benefit from positive niche construction.
Additionally, as environments change, either through negative niche construction or external influences, these larger populations can adapt more quickly.
Finally, because large populations produce more emigrants, these populations will exert a stronger influence on neighboring populations, effectively exporting their niche. Because of these potential benefits, we also focus our attention on how population size and migration rate influence evolutionary outcomes in these environments.
