# Introduction

Cooperative behaviors are common across all branches of the tree of life. Insects divide labor within their colonies, plants and soil bacteria exchange essential nutrients, birds care for others' young, and the trillions of cells in the human body restrain their growth and coordinate to provide vital functions. Each instance of cooperation presents an evolutionary challenge: How can individuals that sacrifice their own well-being to help others avoid subversion by those that do not? Over time, we would expect these *defectors* to rise in abundance at the expense of others, eventually driving cooperators---and perhaps the entire population---to extinction.

Several factors can defer this potential *tragedy of the commons* [@hardin1968tragedy; @hamilton1964geneticalboth; @nowak2006five; @west2007evolutionary]. For example, cooperators must benefit more from the cooperative act than others. This can occur when cooperators are clustered together in spatially-structured populations [@kudzalfick2011high; @fletcher2009simple; @nadell2010emergence] or when cooperators use communication [@darch2012density; @brown2001cooperation] or other cues [@gardner2010greenbeards; @sinervo2006selfrecognition; @veelders2010structural] to cooperate conditionally with kin. Interestingly, cooperation can also be bolstered by genetic linkage with self-benefitting traits [@dandekar2012bacterial; @asfahl2015nonsocial; @foster2004pleiotropy], setting the stage for an "adaptive race" in which cooperators and defectors vie for the first highly-beneficial non-social adaptation [@waite2012adaptation; @morgan2012selection].

@HANKSHAW recently showed that in spatially-structured populations, cooperators gain a substantial leg up on defectors in an adaptive race when the cooperative behavior increases local population density, thus increasing the likelihood of acquiring beneficial non-social mutations. Nevertheless, this advantage is fleeting. As soon as the opportunities for adaptation are exhausted, cooperators are once again at a disadvantage against defectors. However, cooperation can be maintained indefinitely when frequent environmental changes produce a stream of non-social adaptive opportunities (**If this isn't included in Hankshaw paper, remove this sentence and re-write next**). Although natural organisms typically find themselves in changing environments, cooperators may not be able to rely on the the environment to provide sufficient adaptive opportunities for their long-term survival.

Here, we extend the model presented in @HANKSHAW to explore whether the selective feedbacks generated by niche construction can act as a source of adaptive opportunities that enables cooperators to persist. As populations adapt to their environment, they alter selection of non-social alleles. This has several potential benefits for cooperators. First, because populations of cooperators are larger, they are more likely to gain mutations that are beneficial in the changing environment. Similarly, this difference in size means that larger cooperator populations "export" their niche at a higher rate than defectors. Finally, because each population constructs a unique niche, the threat of immigrant defectors may be diminished by maladaptation to a cooperator population's niche.
