We use a computational model to investigate how stress affects cooperation by starting with two types of individuals, producers and non-producers.  The producers pay a competitive cost (c) of public good production.  Population productivity increases as the fraction of producers in the population increases.  The difference in productivity between a group of all producers and one of all defectors is the benefit of production (b) _(*note- add this to full methods description smax - smin = b)._

Evolution occurs in a metapopulation. Each population comprises individuals where each individual is represented as a bit (length = L).  This bit can mutate. The number of 1's at the stress loci is directly proportional to the competitive fitness of the individual. _Wbar is average fitness_.

A simulation run involves cycles of the following processes: population growth, mutation, migration, and dilution. During population growth, competition between individuals occurs within each population. Mutation follows. The probability of an individual mutation from a producer to non-producer (and non-producer to producer) is $\mu_{p}$. The probability that each bit flips its state at the stress loci is $\mu_{s}$. All mutations occur independently. Following mutation, individuals can migrate to a neighboring population at rate m. Finally, dilution thins the population and the cycle repeats.

In some simulations a new stress is periodically experienced. Each individual survives the stress with probability $\mu_{t}$. Each stress locus is reset to 0 (as the organism is not adapted to the new stress).
