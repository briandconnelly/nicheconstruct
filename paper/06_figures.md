## Figure 1

![**Adaptation, Hitchhiking, and the Evolution of Cooperation.** The proportion of cooperators present in the population is shown for the duration of simulations. Curves show the average among replicate populations, and shaded areas indicate 95% confidence intervals. Unless otherwise noted, parameter values are listed in [Table 1](#tables). (**A**) Without any opportunity to adapt ($L$, the number of adaptive loci, is zero), cooperation is quickly lost. (**B**) When adaptation can occur ($L=5$), but populations do not alter their environment ($\epsilon$, the intensity of niche construction, is zero), cooperation hitchhikes along with adaptions, allowing cooperators to temporarily rise in abundance before eventually going extinct.](../figures/Figure1.png)

## Figure 2

![**Niche Construction and the Evolution of Cooperation.** The proportion of cooperators present in the population is shown for the duration of simulations. Curves show the average among replicate populations, and shaded areas indicate 95% confidence intervals. (**A**) Niche construction enables cooperation to be maintained indefinitely. In the majority of populations, cooperation remained as the dominant strategy. (**B**) When niche construction is removed and the fitness benefit of adaptation is increased as compensation ($\epsilon=0$, $\delta=0.6$), adapted defectors arise and drive cooperators to extinction. (**C**) Without negative niche construction, cooperation is not maintained ($A=5$). Here again, cooperators are at a selective disadvantage against equally-adapted defectors.](../figures/Figure2.png)

## Figure 3


![**Niche Construction and Invasion.** Curves trace the proportion of cooperators present in the population for the duration of 160 replicate simulations. These experiments examine whether a strategy initiated at a single population in the center of the metapopulation lattice ($N^{2}=121$) can invade. Unless otherwise noted, we disable mutations ($\mu_{a}=0, \mu_{c}=0$) to focus on how invasion depends on particular combinations of genotypes. (**A**) When cooperators and defectors are matched (i.e., genotypes [1,2,3,4,5]) and adaptation can not occur, defectors quickly drive cooperators to extinction due to the cost of cooperation. Defectors were stochastically eliminated in 2 replicate populations. (**B**) However, the adaptive opportunities produced by negative niche construction and density dependence enable an adapted cooperator (genotype [1,2,3,4,*6*]) to invade a population of defectors. (**C**) These same adaptive opportunities can allow cooperators to resist invasion by initially-matching defectors, which arise via mutation and remain a constant threat. Here, cooperation persisted in 91 populations ($\mu_{a}=0.00005$, the base mutation rate).](../figures/Figure3.png)
