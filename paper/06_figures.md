## Figure 1

![**Adaptation, niche construction, and the evolution of cooperation.** The proportion of cooperators present in the population is shown for the duration of simulations. Curves show the average among replicates, and shaded areas indicate 95% confidence intervals. Unless otherwise noted, parameter values used are listed in [Table 1](#tables). (**A**) When there is no opportunity for adaptation ($L$, the number of adaptive loci, is zero), cooperation is quickly lost. (**B**) When adaptation can occur ($L=5$), but populations do not alter their environment ($\epsilon$, the intensity of niche construction, is zero), cooperators temporarily rise in abundance before eventually going extinct. (**C**) Niche construction enables cooperation to be maintained indefinitely. After 3000 cycles, cooperation was the dominant phenotype in 13 of 18 replicate populations.](../figures/Figure1.png)

![**Niche Construction and the Evolution of Cooperation.** The proportion of cooperators present in the population is shown for the duration of simulations. Curves show the average among replicates, and shaded areas indicate 95% confidence intervals. (**A**) Niche construction enables cooperation to be maintained indefinitely. In the majority of populations, cooperation remained as the dominant strategy. (**B**) When niche construction is removed ($\epsilon=0$) and the fitness benefit of adaptation is increased as compensation ($\delta=0.6$), cooperation is quickly lost when adapted defectors arise. (**C**) Positive niche construction alone can not maintain cooperation ($A=5$). Here again, cooperation is driven to extinction by equally-adapted defectors. (**D**) However, negative niche construction alone is also not sufficient to maintain cooperation, and cooperators are rapidly lost. (TODO do we know how?)](../figures/Figure2.png)

![**Fitness Effects of Mutation Accumulation by Cooperators and Defectors.** Lines indicate the grand mean of cooperator (blue) and defector (red) fitness among replicate populations, while shaded areas indicate 95% confidence intervals. Upper and lower dotted lines indicate the maximum fitness values achievable by defectors and cooperators, respectively. (**A**) In the presence of niche construction, cooperators persist in the population by maintaining a greater mean fitness. (**B**) When selective values are increased ($\delta=0.6$), populations rapidly adapt. In the absence of niche construction ($\epsilon=0$), defectors eventually become equally adapted and surpass cooperators. At this point, cooperators are driven from the population due to the cost of cooperation. (**C**) With the effects of niche construction removed ($\epsilon=0$), positive niche construction prolongs the time when cooperators are at an advantage over defectors. Once again, however, defectors eventually become equally adapted, leading to the loss of cooperation. (**D**) Without positive niche construction or further adaptive opportunities ($L=1$, $a_{max}=6$) cooperators do not benefit from niche construction.](../figures/Figure3.png)

### Figure 6A - Effect of Public Good Benefit (Smax-Smin)

![**Cooperator Presence as a Function of Population Size and Migration Rate.** Cooperator presence for each replicate population is shown as an open circle. The mean among these replicates is represented by a filled circle, and bars indicate 95% confidence intervals. (**A**) Cooperator presence increases proportional to increases in population size. Here, the benefit of cooperation ($S_{max}$) is varied (the density-dependent fitness effects of niche construction are adjusted accordingly in the model parameter $\epsilon$).  (**B**) Cooperator presence decreases with migration rate ($m$). When migration is low, cooperators can not export their niche, which limits expansion. When migration is high, the defectors immigrate into populations more quickly than cooperators can adapt.](../figures/Figure6A.png)
