## Figure 1

![**Adaptation, niche construction, and the evolution of cooperation.** Curves show the average cooperator proportion among replicate populations, while shaded areas indicate 95% confidence intervals. Unless otherwise noted, parameter values used are listed in [Table 1](#tables). (**A**) When there is no opportunity for adaptation ($L$, the number of adaptive loci, is zero), cooperation is quickly lost. (**B**) When adaptation can occur ($L=5$), but populations do not alter their environment ($\epsilon$, the intensity of niche construction, is zero), cooperators temporarily rise in abundance before eventually going extinct. (**C**) Selective feedbacks from niche construction allow cooperation to be the dominant phenotype in 13 of 18 replicate populations.](../figures/Figure1.png)

![**Evolutionary Processes and their Effect on Cooperator Presence.** (**A**) In our model, adaptations allow cooperation to hitchhike. This effect is transient, which limits cooperator presence. (**B**) In the presence of niche construction (positive and negative), cooperator presence is significantly increased. (**C**) When incorporating the potential benefits that it provides, but removing the selective feedback produced by niche construction, cooperator presence is unaffected. (**D**) Positive niche construction increases cooperator proportion, but not to the levels seen in B. (**E**) Negative niche construction alone does not account for the increase in cooperator presence. In these box plots, whiskers show range of data within 1.5 IQR.](../figures/Figure2-edited.pdf)

![**Fitness Effects of Mutation Accumulation by Cooperators and Defectors.** Lines indicate the grand mean of cooperator (blue) and defector (red) fitness among replicate populations, while shaded areas indicate 95% confidence intervals. Upper and lower dotted lines indicate the maximum fitness values achievable by defectors and cooperators, respectively. (**A**) In the presence of niche construction, cooperators persist in the population by maintaining a greater mean fitness. (**B**) When selective values are increased ($\delta=0.6$), populations rapidly adapt. In the absence of niche construction ($\epsilon=0$), defectors eventually become equally adapted and surpass cooperators. At this point, cooperators are driven from the population due to the cost of cooperation. (**C**) With the effects of niche construction removed ($\epsilon=0$), positive niche construction prolongs the time when cooperators are at an advantage over defectors. Once again, however, defectors eventually become equally adapted, leading to the loss of cooperation. (**D**) Without positive niche construction or further adaptive opportunities ($L=1$, $a_{max}=6$) cooperators do not benefit from niche construction.](../figures/Figure3.png)

### Figure 6A - Effect of Public Good Benefit (Smax-Smin)

![**Cooperator Presence as a Function of Population Size and Migration Rate.** Cooperator presence for each replicate population is shown as an open circle. The mean among these replicates is represented by a filled circle, and bars indicate 95% confidence intervals. (**A**) Cooperator presence increases proportional to increases in population size. Here, the benefit of cooperation ($S_{max}$) is varied. ww (**B**) Cooperator presence decreases with migration rate ($m$). When migration is low, cooperators can not export their niche, which limits expansion. When migration is high, the defectors immigrate into populations more quickly than cooperators can adapt.](../figures/Figure6A.png)
