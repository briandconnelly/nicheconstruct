Through their interactions, their activities, and even their mere presence,
organisms change the environment for themselves and others. This "niche
construction" process becomes particularly interesting when it creates
evolutionary feedback, whereby selective pressures are altered in response to
the change. Here we consider how niche construction may influence the evolution
of cooperation, which has been a long-standing challenge to evolutionary
theory. We simulate populations of individuals that cooperatively produce a
public good that permits increased growth in a stressful environment. With this
model, we investigate how local- and global-scale niche construction affects
how well these populations resist invasion by non-producing cheats. We find
that niche construction profoundly impacts the evolution of cooperation by
creating new opportunities for adaptation. Cooperators are able to escape
subversion by cheats as long as niche construction clears these adaptive paths.
This work provides a step towards understanding how evolution occurs in complex
environments like those found in nature.
