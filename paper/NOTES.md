# Length and focus

All papers must focus on timely research which provides new insights into
aspects of evolutionary ecology. The topic should be original and of general
interest to our readers. Original research articles present the results of
empirical and theoretical investigations, addressing clear questions or
hypotheses in evolutionary ecology. Original research articles must not have
more than 7,000 words. The key ideas, assumptions and results of theoretical
papers should be presented in such a way that they are understandable for
non-mathematical readers. Review Articles (8,000) survey recent developments
and major advances in evolutionary ecology. Reviews should be of interest to a
broad audience and they are expected both to summarize existing knowledge and
to propose novel ideas and hypotheses for future research.
 
# Style and structure

Both American and British English are acceptable. Use a clear, concise style,
and avoid the use of the passive voice wherever possible. Please be as concise
as possible, consistent with an appropriate level of explanation for the
science presented. Manuscripts must include line numbering to assist reviewers
and they must have numbers on all pages. Use a standard 12-point font (Times,
Arial, or Courier) on a page set up for standard size paper with wide margins.
All elements of the manuscript must be double spaced. Research articles should
be in the following order: Title page, Abstract, Introduction, Materials and
Methods, Results, Discussion, Acknowledgments, References, Appendixes (for
online publication only), Tables, and Figures. Each table and figure should
begin on a new page. For the other manuscript types the author(s) should find
an appropriate way to structure the paper, ensuring maximum clarity and
coherence.
