## Niche construction prolongs cooperator survival

Introduce Figure 1. Compare 1A (no adaptation) and 1B (GNH) with 1C, which is the NCNH treatment

End prompting the question of what is underlying this effect

## Not Just Because of Additional Fitness from Epsilon

Introduce Figure 2. compare 2A and 2B, which shows control run with 2x delta

Introduce Figure 3 (Fitness). Compare 3A with 3B. Discuss why fitness in NCNH treatment doesn't reach max.


## Negative Niche construction helps

In 1C, 2A, and 3A there was negative niche construction from the wraparound. Is this necessary?

Figs 2C and 3C show the data from runs without negative. **NOTE** Going to have to think more about 3C.

Figs 2D and 3D show the extreme niche construction. Here, this constant selection for adaptations doesn't maintain cooperation.
