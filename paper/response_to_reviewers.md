> Here are my own comments about what I think are the most important points made by reviewer 1:

>He said "An important question for me is whether this mechanism really stabilises cooperation or merely slows its decline."  He also said "Does that fact that p is set to 0.5 at the start of the simulations make this paper really about the persistence of cooperation rather than its evolution? To show the latter, would the authors not consider testing their model with an initial p of 1/800 i.e. a single mutation? In how many such runs does cooperation then persist?"
There is a bit of a terminology mess here.  By "evolution" he means the origin and
spread of cooperation, which would be the case if the frequency increased from a very small value (as he said).  You started at 0.5 which might mean it is indeed more about maintainance than spread from a small value.  Regardless of what you call it, you actually cannot say that you are showing a mechanisms of stabilization unless you start at BOTH a small and a large value.  Stabilisation means that there is some kind of stable equilibrium. You cannot tell from only starting at 0.5, as you will see from any population genetics textbook.  Please fix this by starting at both a low and a high initial frequency.   This is the main reason I'm calling this a major revison.  Easy to do and report on but it will take more time than just rewriting.

TODO

> Here is another statement by this reviewer which I don't agree with: "Is this really negative niche-construction - "niche-constructing acts that, on average decrease the fitness of the niche-constructing organisms" - in the model, the niche-construction shifts the optimum value in the environment, but does not directly reduce fitness of the niche-constructors - instead it makes a higher relative fitness possible for others."  Evolution is about relative fitness, not absolute fitness (his comments are about absolute fitness), so, given that you have shown increased fitness of others but unchanged for the target, it's relative fitness (relative to the others)
HAS declined and you DO have negative niche construction.  Maybe just make this more explicit.

TODO

> Please give more thought and discussion about the external and the constructed environments, they are not necessarily coupled, in fact in some ways this is the entire point of niche construction.

TODO

> As reviewer 2 says, "More robust justification for imposing a ~90% death rate on each subpopulation every generation" is badly needed!  This is rather unrealistic, and makes the entire model rather dubious, unless you can show the same effects with a more realistic death rate (say 30%).

TODO


## Reviewer 1

> This paper extends an existing agent-based model of the evolution of cooperation through the effect of cooperation producing higher population densities, therefore higher absolute number of mutations and hence higher numbers of beneficial adaptations to what is termed the "external" environment, to incorporate the concept of niche construction and argue that what the authors term 'negative niche construction', but what I feel might be better represented as niche creation or extension, can actually stabilise costly cooperation in metapopulations.

> I found a lot to like in the paper and I definitely think it should be published. The model is a really neat (in the sense of elegant enough to facilitate real understanding, which is not something you can say about all agent-based models) take on the problem of coming up with tractable models to explore complex evolutionary interactions like niche construction. The main finding is clear, and the whole package is very nicely presented. I thought the analysis of the contrast between ecological (invasion) and evolutionary effects was particularly nice. There is nothing I strongly disagree with, but I do have a series of thoughts and questions about the paper which the authors could reflect on, along with some specific points where I felt presentation could be improved or clarified.


### General Questions

> An important question for me is whether this mechanism really stabilises cooperation or merely slows its decline. I look at Figure 1C and I see that while p is still non zero by T=3000, it is clearly declining. Would it eventually hit zero again or is an equilibrium achieved? Is the use of 'indefinitely' on L305 justified? Perhaps this is more of a presentation thing, because in Figure 2A it is clear that there are many populations with high levels of cooperation, albeit with a lot of oscillation - for me this begs the question of how big the metapopulation needs to be to buffer effectively against this degree of stochasticityâ€¦

TODO

> Does that fact that p is set to 0.5 at the start of the simulations make this paper really about the persistence of cooperation rather than its evolution? To show the latter, would the authors not consider testing their model with an initial p of 1/800 i.e. a single mutation? In how many such runs does cooperation then persist?

This is a very important point that should have been addressed in the original manuscript. To address this omission, we have conducted further simulations in which the initial proportion of cooperators were widely varied. The results of these simulations are included in the revised manuscript. **TODO: specific location of results and figures**. **TODO: brief description of the results**.

Due to the thinning that occurs stochastically at the onset of each simulation (to maintain similarity with the Hammarlund paper), we have not performed simulations in which p0=1/800, which is a very interesting suggestion. (**TODO: should we add the ability to conduct a simulation starting with one cooperator?**). However, we have included results of simulations in which cooperators were entirely absent from the starting population. **TODO: summary of results and where we've discussed/shown them**.

> Is this really negative niche-construction - "niche-constructing acts that, on average decrease the fitness of the niche-constructing organisms" - in the model, the niche-construction shifts the optimum value in the environment, but does not directly reduce fitness of the niche-constructors - instead it makes a higher relative fitness possible for others.

TODO

> There is a separation in the model between the "external" environment and the "constructed" environment, neither of which are modelled independently; rather they are implied from the way that the genetic makeup of organisms affects their fitness. This seems like a weak point of the model given that this separation is clearly an artificial construct - it would help the paper if the authors could give some thought to justifying this distinction - why doesn't niche construction affect the "external" environment. For example, is this a way that host/parasite interactions have been previously modelled? Further to this point, adaptation is usually associated with some degree of genetic load - i.e. the difference between optimal and actual genotypes in a given environment (e.g. L255). Can the authors say anything about whether an assumption of no genetic load is critical to their findings, or whether they think it is implicitly accounted for in their model in some way I have
missed?

TODO

> The setup of the circular chromosome and circular fitness implications is mathematically neat - however, it seems like a very specific set of assumptions about gene/environment interactions (for example, only when the modulus of L/A is non-zero) and one always worries about the generality of insights based on such a specific system. Can the authors provide any more information about where these assumptions might be met in nature, and/or what range of conditions or assumptions are needed for their insights to hold.

TODO

> Increased population density has only positive effects here - but density can also bring costs - this is ignored in the linear population growth of Eq 4; is it possible to say anything about how much cost can be borne before the effect disappears?

TODO

### Minor Issues

> L16 I thought the description of the Hammerlund paper was too long for the abstract.

TODO

> L41 I think cooperation should be precisely defined here, with respect to the distinction between cooperation for mutual benefit (albeit with risk of defection), and altruism, whereby altruists always 'lose out' in the short term by their behaviour.  Which precisely do the authors think they are describing - it seems to me that it partly depends on the model parameters, but it is a bit difficult to tease out with the collective benefits conferred by Equation 4, but it seems more like altruism to me, and that's what the authors seem to suggest ('sacrificing their wellbeing to help others')?

TODO

> L69 Personally I find the Tom Robbins analogy a bit of a stretch and while I know the literature in question many will not so it's kind of unclear what's added here; it's also potentially confusing - Sissy's thumbs help her hitchhike as much as anyone else, so it's not clearly paying a cost to help others.

TODO

> L151 Eq (1) - I think a one sentence explanation of what this equation does would save readers some effort in understanding here.

TODO

> L157 Why is the subscript 'g' needed here? I can't see where this is ever summed over in the subsequent equations, so the notation might be overcomplicated here.

We have removed the 'g' subscript from all instances where allelic states are represented.

> L172 / Eq 4 The costs and benefits of cooperation are always crucial in models like this, but while the costs are clear, the benefits are spread out using this equation. I feel like this should be clarified a little more - can the effects of this equation be reproduced in equation 2 such that both the costs and benefits of cooperation are explicitly expressed through effects on individual fitness?

TODO

> L185 Just a point of clarification - mutation can result in "no adaptation" right? Is there a reasons for the {0}U{1,2,3â€¦} notation rather than the simpler {0,1,2,3,â€¦} - the union operator doesn't seem to serve any purpose here?

We have removed the union operation in favor of the simplified set {0, 1, ..., A}.

> L192 why use boundaries rather than toroid?

While we realize that using a bounded lattice may introduce effects at the edges, we chose to not use a torus primarily to maintain consistency with the Hammarlund et al. paper. For that work, our primary motivations for having boundaries were to simplify both the description and visualization of space (and distances), particularly for those not accustomed to thinking about toroidal surfaces. We did not find significant differences between a bounded lattice and one with periodic boundaries during exploratory simulations for that work.

> L202 Is this right? - if each individual remains with probability d  then with d=0.1 as per Table 1, then the population is reduced to < Smin (800) even when at its maximum size (0.1*Smax = 200) - why parameterise in this case, rather than just choosing Smin individuals at random?

TODO

> L210 "performED" and I would argue results should be past tense throughout.

TODO

> L262 The authors state that setting L=A changes the niche construction from positive to negative. I am afraid I completely missed the reasoning here and I think the paper would be improved if it were spelled out more clearly why this parameter setting induces positive niche construction (i.e. an increase in constructor fitness by their construction activity).

TODO

> L386-388 I think this point about representing the niche, or environment, explicitly, is more important than the attention it is given here...

TODO

> L410-411 - this doesn't appear to be a proper sentence.

This has been addressed in the current manuscript with the addition of an "of" to identify what is being produced.

> Table 1 - aswell as base values, it would be useful to show which further values were explored for each parameter, to judge where parameters space has been explored.

TODO


## Reviewer 2

> This paper shows that negative niche construction can create the opportunity for new adaptation and maintain a costly trait that increases local population density in a population where it would otherwise be driven to extinction.

> The idea is interesting and I am happy to recommend publication with some minor changes and with some small clarifications.

### General Questions

> The definition of cooperation used here appears to be that cooperation is a costly behaviour that increases local population density. The authors do briefly mention the negative aspects of high local population density in terms of increased competition on pages 18/19 but this discussion does not extend to the model. In fact, the authors avoid this issue by diluting the population 'to allow growth in the next generation'. More robust justification for imposing a ~90% death rate on each subpopulation every generation may be needed as it could favour the cooperative allele substantially. What would the authors expect to see if local competition was explicitly modelled?

TODO

> Could 'adaptation to external environment' be rolled in to baseline fitness? It seems that 0 alleles (except at the cooperation locus, of course) are always selected against and should drop out of the population quite quickly. What would change if the third term in equation (2) were omitted?

TODO

> Migration could be explained in a bit more detail. For example, does migration occur symmetrically in order to avoid some subpopulations stochastically exceeding S_max? If not, how is this avoided? The text on the bottom of page 6 and the top of page 7 suggests that the rate of migration depends on success or fitness. Is this reflecting frequency dependence only or some other mechanism?

TODO

> Finally, if I understand correctly, the force maintaining cooperation is a constant opportunity to adapt and maintain the benefit of having a large local population to generate useful adaptations. Is there a fundamental difference between the way in which this is modelled here (as a feature of the niche constructing genotypes of the individual agents) and modelling this as a straightforward variable or fluctuating environment?

TODO

### Minor Issues

> The labelling is a bit difficult to follow at times. I would suggest representing the alleles with letters and the loci with numbers (or vice versa) if possible.

TODO

> Line 196-197. Why not just seed the environment with sigma*S(P_0) individuals rather than the two step process described here?

TODO

> Line 261. Does this only happen when a type has fixed in the subpopulation?

TODO

> Line 265. Without qualification this sentence might be overstating things a bit!

TODO

> Line 271 and others. At times the term 'population' used rather than subpopulation or metapopulation. This should be specified each time.

TODO

> A concluding paragraph that discusses the topic more generally might be more fitting than ending on a discussion of host-symbiont interactions.
