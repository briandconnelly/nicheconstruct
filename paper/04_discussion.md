Despite their negative effects, deleterious traits can rise in abundance due to genetic linkage with other traits that are strongly favored by selection [@maynardsmith1974hitch].
In a process termed the "Hankshaw effect", @HANKSHAW recently demonstrated that cooperative behaviors can prolong their existence by actively increasing their likelihood of hitchhiking with a beneficial trait.
While this process does favor cooperation in the short term, it eventually reaches a dead end.
When the opportunities for adaptation are exhausted, and cooperators can no longer hitchhike, they face extinction.
In this work, we have considered whether niche construction can maintain cooperation indefinitely.

We demonstrate that when niche construction occurs, cooperation can indeed persist (Figure 1C).
But what aspects of niche construction produce this result?
In our model, niche construction introduces additional selective effects that could influence the evolutionary process.
However, simply raising the selective benefits provided by adaptations does not significantly increase cooperator presence (Figure 2, columns C and A), and indicates that niche construction plays an important role.
Although cooperators benefit greatly from positive niche construction, it does not fully explain our results (Figure 2 D).
Indeed, despite an initial increase in abundance, cooperators are eventually driven to extinction when environmental change produces only positive fitness effects (Figure 1D).
As with the Hankshaw effect, adaption eventually slows, allowing defectors to outcompete cooperators (Figure 3C).
While it does not benefit cooperation when alone (Figure 3E), negative niche construction acts to prevent this stasis.
Combined, we find that both positive and negative niche construction are required to main cooperation.

When successful, we observe that populations do not reach the maximum possible fitness (Figure 3A).
Although cooperation is the focus of this study, it can be seen as deleterious.
Previous work has shown that niche construction can favor deleterious alleles [@laland1999evolutionary; @laland1996evolutionary].
Similarly here, cooperation is maintained in the presence of niche construction, but lost otherwise (Figure 2).
@vandyken2012origins showed that when two cooperative behaviors co-evolve and niche construction feedbacks benefit the other type, niche construction can increasingly favor these traits, which were otherwise disfavored when alone.

By their very nature, public goods benefit populations by making their environment more hospitable [@west2007social].
For example, bacteria produce a host of extracellular products that find soluble iron [@griffin2004cooperation], digest large proteins [@darch2012density; @diggle2007cooperation], and reduce the risk of predation [@cosson2002pseudomonas].
While many studies have explored how the environment affects the evolution of cooperative behaviors such as these, relatively few have examined how those behaviors affect the environment and how the resulting feedbacks influence evolutionary trajectories.

In our model, the environmental state was implicitly modeled, and depended solely on the current state of the population.
In natural settings, however, the timescales at which environments are modified and reproduction are likely to be decoupled.
For example, a multitude of factors including protein durability [@brown2007durability; @kummerli2010molecular], diffusion [@driscoll2010theory; @allison2005cheaters], and resource availability [@zhang2013exploring; @ghoul2014experimental] influence both the rate and the degree to which public goods alter the environment.
These factors are likely to influence evolutionary trajectories [@laland1996evolutionary].
@lehmann2007evolution demonstrated that a cooperative, niche constructing behavior can be favored when it only affected selection for future generations, thus reducing the potential for competition among contemporary kin. The evolutionary inertia that this creates, however, may ultimately work against cooperators.
When public good accumulates in the environment, cooperators must reduce their investment in production to remain competitive [@kummerli2010molecular; @dumas2012cost].
Cooperation that occurs facultatively, perhaps by sensing the abiotic [@koestler2014bile; @bernier2011modulation] or biotic environment [@darch2012density; @brown2001cooperation], are likely to be favored in these fluctuating environments.

In many instances of cooperation, the environment is itself a biological entity, which can produce additional evolutionary feedbacks.
As the host population changes, so too will selection on their symbiont populations.
Here, evolutionary outcomes depend greatly on the degree of shared interest between the host and symbiont.
For example, the cooperative production of virulence factors by the human pathogen *P. aeruginosa* in lung infections is harmful to those with cystic fibrosis [@harrison2007microbial].
Conversely, cooperative light production by *A. fischeri* is vital for the survival of its host, the Hawaiian bobtail squid [@ruby1996lessons].
It was recently argued that incorporating the effects of niche construction is critical for improving our understanding of viral evolution [@hamblin2014viral] and evolution in co-infecting parasites [@hafer2015when].
Incorporating host dynamics, co-evolution, and the feedbacks that they produce into models is likely to be equally important for gaining an understanding of how cooperative behaviors evolve in these host-symbiont settings.
