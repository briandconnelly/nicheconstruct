Niche construction and other social interactions

## Public Goods

TODO: merge this in with the "Cooperative Niche Construction" section [TEST](Coopeative Niche Construction)

By their very nature, public goods benefit populations by making their environment more hospitable. For example, bacteria produce extracellular products that find soluble iron [@griffin2004cooperation], digest large proteins [@darch2012density; @diggle2007cooperation], and reduce the risk of predation [@cosson2002pseudomonas], among many others [@west2007social]. While many studies have explored how the environment affects the evolution of cooperative bahviors, relatively few have examined how those behaviors affect the environment and the resulting change in evolutionary trajectories. @lehmann2007evolution demonstrated analytically that when niche construction act benefits future generations, cooperation is favored due to reduced competition among kin. When rate-benefitting and yield-benefitting altruistic acts co-evolve, @vandyken2012origins showed that "reciprocal niche construction", where the selective feedbacks produced by one act benefitted the other, can lead to increased selection for both traits. While these studies have focused on the niche constructing effects of cooperation, we instead focus our attention here on how niche construction enables cooperators to escape defection by hitchhiking along with non-social traits.

## Primacy/Recency

In our model, alterations to the environment were immediately echoed by changes in selection. However, decoupling the timescales on which these processes occur can have substantial effects [@laland1996evolutionary]. By integrating past allelic states into Equation @eq:fitness, we can begin to explore how the cumulative effects of niche construction affect the creation of non-social adaptive opportunities and the benefits that they offer cooperation. Here, how these past allelic states are integrated will play an important role. For example, when the effects of earlier generations are weighted more heavily, the influence of migration may be diminished. While this will reduce the threat of emigration by defectors, cooperator populations will also be less effective at exporting their niche.

## Cooperative Niche Construction

While our focus for this work has been on the eco-evolutionary feedbacks created by non-social traits, it would also be interesting to explore how this system is affected by the timescale at which carrying capacity at a given patch is increased by public goods. In natural settings, a multitude of factors including protein durability [@brown2007durability; @kummerli2010molecular], diffusion [@driscoll2010theory; @allison2005cheaters], and resource availability [@zhang2013exploring; @ghoul2014experimental] influence both the rate and the degree to which public goods alter the environment (and thereby selection). @lehmann2007evolution demonstrated that a cooperative, niche constructing behavior can be favored when it only affected selection for future generations, thus reducing the potential for competition among contemporary kin. The evolutionary inertia that this creates, however, may ultimately work against cooperators. When public good accumulates in the environment, cooperators must reduce their investment in production to remain competitive [@kummerli2010molecular].

TODO: wrap up. Facultative cooperation requires sensing.

## Host-Symbiont

In many instances of cooperation, the environment is itself a biological entity, which can produce additional evolutionary feedbacks. As the host population changes, so too will selection on their symbiont populations. Here, evolutionary outcomes depend greatly on the degree of shared interest between the host and symbiont. For example, the cooperative production of virulence factors by the human pathogen *P. aeruginosa* in lung infections is harmful to those with cystic fibrosis [@harrison2007microbial]. Conversely, cooperative light production by *A. fischeri* is vital for the survival of its host, the Hawaiian bobtail squid [@ruby1996lessons]. It was recently argued that incorporating the effects of niche construction is critical for improving our understanding of viral evolution [@hamblin2014viral] and evolution in co-infecting parasites [@hafer2015when]. Incorporating host dynamics, co-evolution, and the feedbacks that they produce into models is likely to be equally important for gaining an understanding of how cooperative behaviors evolve in these host-symbiont settings.
