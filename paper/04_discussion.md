Despite their negative effects, deleterious traits can rise in abundance due to genetic linkage with other traits that are strongly favored by selection [@maynardsmith1974hitch].
In a process termed the "Hankshaw effect", @HANKSHAW recently demonstrated that cooperative behaviors can prolong their existence by actively increasing their likelihood of hitchhiking with a beneficial trait.
While this process favors cooperation in the short term, it eventually reaches a dead end.
When the opportunities for adaptation are exhausted and cooperators can no longer hitchhike, they face extinction.
In this work, we have considered whether niche construction can maintain cooperation indefinitely.

Our results reveal that with niche construction, cooperation can indeed persist (Figure 1C).
But what it is it about this process that maintains cooperation?
In our model, niche construction introduces additional selective effects that could influence the evolutionary process.
However, simply raising the selective benefits provided by adaptations does not significantly increase cooperator presence (Figure 2, columns C and A), and indicates that niche construction plays an important role.
Although cooperators benefit greatly from positive niche construction, it does not fully explain our results (Figure 2 D).
Indeed, despite an initial increase in abundance, cooperators are eventually driven to extinction when environmental change produces only positive fitness effects (Figure 1D).
As with the "Hankshaw effect", adaption eventually slows, allowing defectors to outcompete cooperators (Figure 3C).
While it does not benefit cooperation when alone (Figure 3E), negative niche construction acts to prevent this stasis.
Combined, we find that both positive and negative niche construction are required to main cooperation.

This work further demonstrates that niche 

Previously, @vandyken2012origins showed that 


By their very nature, public goods benefit populations by making their environment more hospitable [@west2007social].
For example, bacteria produce a host of extracellular products that find soluble iron [@griffin2004cooperation], digest large proteins [@darch2012density; @diggle2007cooperation], and reduce the risk of predation [@cosson2002pseudomonas].
While many studies have explored how the environment affects the evolution of cooperative behaviors such as these, relatively few have examined how those behaviors affect the environment and how the resulting feedbacks influence evolutionary trajectories.
@lehmann2007evolution demonstrated analytically that when niche construction benefits future generations, cooperation is favored due to reduced competition among kin.
When rate-benefitting and yield-benefitting altruistic acts co-evolve, @vandyken2012origins showed that "reciprocal niche construction", where the selective feedbacks produced by one act benefitted the other, can lead to increased selection for both traits.

TODO: primacy/recency

In our model, alterations to the environment were immediately echoed by changes in selection. However, decoupling the timescales on which these processes occur can have substantial effects [@laland1996evolutionary]. By integrating past allelic states into Equation @eq:fitness, we can begin to explore how the cumulative effects of niche construction affect the creation of non-social adaptive opportunities and the benefits that they offer cooperation. Here, how these past allelic states are integrated will play an important role. For example, when the effects of earlier generations are weighted more heavily, the influence of migration may be diminished. While this will reduce the threat of emigration by defectors, cooperator populations will also be less effective at exporting their niche.




In many instances of cooperation, the environment is itself a biological entity, which can produce additional evolutionary feedbacks.
As the host population changes, so too will selection on their symbiont populations.
Here, evolutionary outcomes depend greatly on the degree of shared interest between the host and symbiont.
For example, the cooperative production of virulence factors by the human pathogen *P. aeruginosa* in lung infections is harmful to those with cystic fibrosis [@harrison2007microbial].
Conversely, cooperative light production by *A. fischeri* is vital for the survival of its host, the Hawaiian bobtail squid [@ruby1996lessons].
It was recently argued that incorporating the effects of niche construction is critical for improving our understanding of viral evolution [@hamblin2014viral] and evolution in co-infecting parasites [@hafer2015when].
Incorporating host dynamics, co-evolution, and the feedbacks that they produce into models is likely to be equally important for gaining an understanding of how cooperative behaviors evolve in these host-symbiont settings.

While our focus for this work has been on the eco-evolutionary feedbacks created by non-social traits, it would also be interesting to explore how this system is affected by the timescale at which carrying capacity at a given patch is increased by public goods. In natural settings, a multitude of factors including protein durability [@brown2007durability; @kummerli2010molecular], diffusion [@driscoll2010theory; @allison2005cheaters], and resource availability [@zhang2013exploring; @ghoul2014experimental] influence both the rate and the degree to which public goods alter the environment (and thereby selection). @lehmann2007evolution demonstrated that a cooperative, niche constructing behavior can be favored when it only affected selection for future generations, thus reducing the potential for competition among contemporary kin. The evolutionary inertia that this creates, however, may ultimately work against cooperators. When public good accumulates in the environment, cooperators must reduce their investment in production to remain competitive [@kummerli2010molecular].

TODO: wrap up. Facultative cooperation requires sensing.
