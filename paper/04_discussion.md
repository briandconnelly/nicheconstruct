Despite their negative effects, deleterious traits can rise in abundance due to genetic linkage with other traits that are strongly favored by selection [@maynardsmith1974hitch].
In a process termed the "Hankshaw effect", @HANKSHAW recently demonstrated that cooperation can prolong its existence by increasing the likelihood of hitchhiking with a beneficial trait.
While this process does favor cooperation in the short term, it eventually reaches a dead end; when the opportunities for adaptation are exhausted, and cooperators can no longer hitchhike, they face extinction.
In this work, we have considered whether niche construction might serve to perpetually generate new adaptive opportunities, and thus favor cooperation indefinitely.

When niche construction occurs, cooperation can indeed persist ([Figure 2C](#fig2)).
In our model, niche construction introduces additional selective effects that could influence the evolutionary process, leading to a more pronounced Hankshaw effect.
However, simply raising the selective benefits provided by adaptations does not prolong cooperation ([Figure 3B](#fig3)), and indicates that niche construction plays an important role.

We find that cooperator success is due to niche construction.
Further, we find that it is specifically negative niche construction that maintains cooperation ([Figure 3C](#fig3)).
Without adaptive opportunities, adaptation eventually grinds to a halt.
Once this occurs, cooperators face the threat of invasion by defectors that arise de novo through mutation.
Since these defectors are equally adapted but do not bear the cost of cooperation, they quickly drive cooperators to extinction.
Because every genotype constructs an environment in which a different genotype is more fit, negative niche construction creates continual adaptive opportunities.
These opportunities can allow cooperators to resist invasion by defectors, even when defectors are equally adapted ([Figure 4B](#fig4)).
It is these recurring cycles of invasion and adaptation that underlie the oscillations in cooperator populations that we see in [Figure 3A](#fig3).
Here we observe another facet of the Hankshaw effect: because populations of cooperators are larger, they are better able to respond to the adaptive opportunities that result from negative niche construction.
When cooperators are not able to stochastically gain adaptations, defectors invade, and the cycle is broken.

In our model, cooperation and niche construction are orthogonal, which allows us to focus on hitchhiking.
However, the form of cooperation used in this model could itself be seen as a niche constructing behavior.
Explicitly modeling this cooperative behavior, which is akin to the production of public goods, would likely yield additional insights into the relationship between cooperation and niche construction.
For example, previous work has shown that niche construction can favor deleterious alleles [@laland1999evolutionary; @laland1996evolutionary].
Cooperation, especially in competition against equally-adapted defectors, can be considered deleterious, so introducing selective feedbacks from cooperation could further bolster cooperation.
@vandyken2012origins showed that when two cooperative behaviors co-evolve and niche construction feedbacks benefit the other type, niche construction can increasingly favor these traits, which were otherwise disfavored when alone.
Arguably, this can be viewed as another instance of hitchhiking: the maladaptive form of cooperation is maintained by association with the adaptive form. However, negative niche construction then reverses these roles and perpetuates the cycle.

By their very nature, public goods benefit populations by making their environment more hospitable [@west2007social].
For example, bacteria produce a host of extracellular products that scavage soluble iron [@griffin2004cooperation], digest large proteins [@darch2012density; @diggle2007cooperation], and reduce the risk of predation [@cosson2002pseudomonas].
While many studies have focused on how the environment affects the evolution of cooperative behaviors such as the production of these public goods, relatively few have examined how the resulting selective feedbacks influence evolution as public goods modify the environment.
In these instances, environmental changes are likely to occur on different timescales than reproduction.
These differences can have profound effects.
For example, a multitude of factors including protein durability [@brown2007durability; @kummerli2010molecular], diffusion [@driscoll2010theory; @allison2005cheaters], and resource availability [@zhang2013exploring; @ghoul2014experimental] influence both the rate and the degree to which public goods alter the environment.
@lehmann2007evolution demonstrated that cooperative, niche constructing behaviors can be favored when they affect selection for future generations.
When this occurs, conflict among contemporary kin is reduced.
The evolutionary inertia that this creates, however, may ultimately work against cooperators.
When public goods accumulate in the environment, cooperators must decrease production to remain competitive [@kummerli2010molecular; @dumas2012cost].
This favors cooperation that occurs facultatively, perhaps by sensing the abiotic [@koestler2014bile; @bernier2011modulation] or biotic environment [@darch2012density; @brown2001cooperation].

In many instances where cooperation occurs, the environment is itself a biological entity, which can introduce additional evolutionary feedbacks.
As the host population changes, so too does selection on their symbiont populations.
Here, evolutionary outcomes depend greatly on the degree of shared interest between the host and symbiont.
For example, the cooperative production of virulence factors by the human pathogen *P. aeruginosa* in lung infections is harmful to hosts with cystic fibrosis [@harrison2007microbial].
Conversely, cooperative light production by *A. fischeri* is vital for the survival of its host, the Hawaiian bobtail squid [@ruby1996lessons].
It was recently argued that incorporating the effects of niche construction is critical for improving our understanding of viral evolution [@hamblin2014viral] and evolution in co-infecting parasites [@hafer2015when].
Incorporating host dynamics, co-evolution, and the feedbacks that they produce into models is likely to be equally important for gaining an understanding of how cooperative behaviors evolve in these host-symbiont settings.
