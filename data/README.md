| File Name      | Description                                                |
|:---------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------|
| L00.csv        | Combined data from simulations where no adaptation was possible |
| L05_A06_2xDelta_0xEpsilon.csv | Combined data from simulations where the benefits of non-social adaptations are doubled in order to compare against the benefits possible with both non-social adaptation and niche construction |
| L05_A06_1xDelta_1xEpsilon | Combined data from baseline simulation where non-social adaptation and selective feedback from niche construction are included |
| L05_A05_1xDelta_1xEpsilon.csv | Combined data from simulation where negative niche construction was not present |
| L01_A06_1xDelta_1xEpsilon.csv | Combined data from extreme negative niche construction simulations |
