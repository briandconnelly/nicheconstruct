## Abstract (1600 chars)

Through their interactions, their activities, and even their mere presence, organisms change the environment for themselves and others. This "niche construction" process becomes particularly interesting when it creates evolutionary feedback, whereby selective pressures are altered in response to environmental change. With the proposed project, we aim to reveal how niche construction influences the evolution of cooperation, which has been a long-standing challenge to evolutionary theory. We will develop and use a computational model to explore one way in which the selective feedbacks introduced by niche construction may enable cooperators to indefinitely escape subversion by cheats by continually creating opportunities for adaptation. We will then extend the model to explore how niche construction affects co-evolutionary dynamics when the cooperative behaviors of symbionts have fitness consequences for their host. This work provides a crucial step towards understanding how cooperation evolves in complex environments like those found in nature.

## Scientific Strength of the Proposed Project (250 chars)

The selective feedbacks produced as organisms modify their environment have received little attention despite their potential to radically alter evolutionary outcomes. Here we explore how these feedbacks affect the evolution of cooperation.

## Centrality of Project to BEACONâ€™s Mission (250 chars)

This project uses computational modeling to address a fundamental question in evolutionary biology from a new perspective. Besides informing evolutionary theory, knowledge of what maintains cooperation has several practical applications (below).


## Quality of Plan for Obtaining External Funding (250 chars)

Several recent publications have argued that the selective feedback from niche construction is critical for understanding host-pathogen coevolution. Preliminary data from our host-symbiont model will enable a grant submission to the NSF-EEID program.


## Degree of Multidisciplinarity of Project (250 chars)

This project is a collaboration between a computer scientist (Connelly) and a biologist (Turner).


## Impact on Education and Human Resource Development (250 chars)

Connelly is currently developing hands-on activities at the Pacific Science Center that introduce evolution and the effects of environmental change to high school students and the general public. He will lead these several times in the coming year.


## Knowledge Transfer to Industry (250 chars)

Understanding the forces that maintain cooperation is essential in medicine for developing "anti-infective" treatments, in industry for wastewater treatment, and in developing computer networks where resources are shared among devices (e.g., cars).

## Impact on Achieving the Diversity Goals of BEACON (250 chars)

One member of this two-member team is a woman (Turner). She will be directly involved in all aspects of this project, which focuses heavily on mathematical and computational modeling and data analysis.

## Multi-Institutionality (250 chars)

This project is a collaboration between individuals from the University of Washington (Connelly) and Michigan State University (Turner).


## Budget Appropriateness (1600 chars)

All funds will be allocated to salary for Connelly, who will lead model development, run simulations, analyze data, and lead preparation for all manuscripts that result. Computational resources for simulations will be funded by a grant to Connelly from Google.


## Diversity plan (1600 characters maximum)

We have begun contact with a URM/female undergrad who is interested in assisting with model construction and analysis.


## Data management plan (1600 characters maximum)

We are committed to practices that facilitate the maintenance and dissemination of all data produced during and after the duration of the proposed research in a manner consistent with the requirements defined by the NSF as specified in the Grant Proposal Guide. It is a primary concern that all data related to this project are accessible, understandable, usable, and clearly demonstrate the methods used in order to be repeatable. For the purposes of this project, we define data to be software, configuration files, and result data. We include published figures, plots, and tables of data used for making plots as well as curriculum materials for educational and outreach programs. All data will be stored in plain-text formats and will be readable by freely-available software. Descriptive metadata will be included in order to sufficiently annotate all result data and configuration files, as well as to indicate the steps necessary to regenerate those data. All data will be made publicly available and released under licensed approved by the [Open Source Initiative](http://opensource.org).
