Cooperative behaviors are common across all branches of the tree of life.
Insects divide labor within their colonies, plants and soil bacteria exchange
required nutrients, birds care for others' young, and the trillions of cells in
the human body restrain their growth and coordinate with others to provide
vital functions. Each instance of cooperation presents an evolutionary
challenge---how can individuals that sacrifice their own well-being to help
others avoid subversion by those that do not? Over time, we would expect these
"defectors" to rise in abundance at the expense of others, eventually driving
cooperators (and perhaps the entire population) to extinction.

A number of factors can defer this potential *tragedy of the commons*
[@hardin1968tragedy; @hamilton1964geneticalboth; @nowak2006five;
@west2007evolutionary]. For example, it has frequently been demonstrated that
close relatives must be more likely to benefit from the cooperative act than
others. This can occur when cooperators are clustered together in
spatially-structured populations [@kudzalfick2011high; @fletcher2009simple;
@nadell2010emergence] or when cooperators use communication [@darch2012density;
@brown2001cooperation] or other cues [@gardner2010greenbeards] to identify and
cooperate conditionally with kin. Interestingly, cooperation can also be
bolstered by genetic association with vital self-benefitting traits
[@dandekar2012bacterial; @asfahl2015nonsocial; @foster2004pleiotropy], setting
the stage for an "adaptive race" in which cooperators and defectors vie for the
first highly-beneficial non-social adaptation [@waite2012adaptation;
@morgan2012selection]. Using a computational model inspired by corresponding
microbial experiments, we have recently shown that cooperators can have a
substantial leg up on defectors when the cooperative behavior increases
population density and thus the likelihood of acquiring beneficial mutations
(in prep.). However, this advantage is fleeting (Fig. 1A, TODO). Once the
opportunities for adaptation are exhausted, cooperators are once again at a
disadvantage against defectors. As shown in Fig. 1B (TODO), however,
cooperation can be maintained indefinitely when environmental change occurs
frequently, providing a stream of adaptive opportunities. While natural
organisms typically find themselves in changing environments, can cooperators
bet their success on these environments providing a steady influx of adaptive
opportunities?

Our model and others have neglected one potentially major determinant of
evolutionary outcomes---environmental change brought about by the organisms
themselves. Through their metabolism, their interactions with others, and even
through their death, organisms constantly modify their environment. These
changes can produce feedback loops in which environmental change alters
selection, which, in turn, alters phenotypes and their corresponding effects on
the environment. The proposed studies aim to reveal how endogenous
environmental change, or *niche construction* [@odling2003niche], affects the
evolution of cooperation.
