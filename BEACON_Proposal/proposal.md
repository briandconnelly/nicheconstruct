Cooperative behaviors are common across all branches of the tree of life.
Insects divide labor within their colonies, plants and soil bacteria exchange
required nutrients, birds provide care for others' young, and the trillions of
cells in the human body restrain their growth in order to coordinate with
others in providing vital functions. Each instance of cooperation presents an
evolutionary challenge---how can individuals that sacrifice their own
well-being to help others avoid subversion by those that do not? Over time, we
would expect these "defectors" to rise in abundance at the expense of others,
eventually driving cooperators (and perhaps the entire population) to
extinction.

A number of factors can defer this potential *tragedy of the commons*
[@hardin1968tragedy; @hamilton1964geneticalboth; @nowak2006five;
@west2007evolutionary]. Perhaps most critically, cooperation must be more
likely to benefit close relatives than others. This can occur when cooperators
are clustered together in spatially-structured populations
[@kudzalfick2011high; @fletcher2009simple; @nadell2010emergence] or when
cooperators use communication [@darch2012density; @brown2001cooperation] or
other traits [@gardner2010greenbeards] to identify and cooperate conditionally
with kin. Interestingly, genetic association with vital non-cooperative traits
can also bolster cooperation [@dandekar2012bacterial; @asfahl2015nonsocial;
@foster2004pleiotropy], and set the stage for an "adaptive race" in which
cooperators and non-cooperators vie for the first highly-beneficial non-social
adaptation [@waite2012adaptation; @morgan2012selection]. As part of a
BEACON-funded project, we have recently shown using a model inspired by
microbial experimentation that cooperators can have a substantial leg up on
defectors when the cooperative behavior increases population density and thus
the likelihood of acquiring beneficial mutations (manuscript in preparation).
However, this advantage is fleeting (Figure 1A, TODO). Once the opportunities
for adaptation are exhausted, cooperators are once again at a disadvantage
against defectors. As seen in Figure 1B (TODO), however, cooperation can be
maintained indefinitely if environmental change occurs frequently, providing a
constant source of adaptive opportnities.

TODO: what about endogenous change?
