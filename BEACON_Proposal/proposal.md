Cooperative behaviors are common across all branches of the tree of life.
Insects divide labor within their colonies, plants and soil bacteria exchange
required nutrients, birds provide care for others' young, and the trillions of
cells in the human body restrain their growth in order to coordinate with
others in providing vital functions. Each instance of cooperation presents an
evolutionary challenge---how can individuals that sacrifice their own
well-being to help others avoid subversion by those that do not? Over time, we
would expect these "defectors" to rise in abundance at the expense of others,
eventually driving cooperators (and perhaps the entire population) to
extinction.

A number of factors can defer this potential *tragedy of the commons*
[@hardin1968tragedy; @hamilton1964geneticalboth; @nowak2006five;
@west2007evolutionary]. For example, it has frequently been demonstrated that
close relatives must be more likely to benefit from the cooperative act than
others. This can occur when cooperators are clustered together in
spatially-structured populations [@kudzalfick2011high; @fletcher2009simple;
@nadell2010emergence] or when cooperators use communication [@darch2012density;
@brown2001cooperation] or other traits [@gardner2010greenbeards] to identify
and cooperate conditionally with kin. Interestingly, cooperation can also be
bolstered by genetic association with vital non-cooperative traits
[@dandekar2012bacterial; @asfahl2015nonsocial; @foster2004pleiotropy], setting
the stage for an "adaptive race" in which cooperators and non-cooperators vie
for the first highly-beneficial non-social adaptation [@waite2012adaptation;
@morgan2012selection]. As part of a BEACON-enabled project, we have recently
shown using a model inspired by corresponding microbial experiments that
cooperators can have a substantial leg up on defectors when the cooperative
behavior increases population density and thus the likelihood of acquiring
beneficial mutations (in prep.). However, this advantage is fleeting (Fig. 1A,
TODO). Once the opportunities for adaptation are exhausted, cooperators are
once again at a disadvantage against defectors.  As seen in Fig. 1B (TODO),
however, cooperation can be maintained indefinitely when environmental change
occurs frequently, providing a constant source of adaptive opportunities. While
natural organisms typically find themselves in changing environments, can
cooperators rely on these environments to provide a steady influx of adaptive
opportunities?

Our model and others have neglected one potentially major determinant of
evolutionary outcomes---environmental change brought about by the organisms
themselves. Organisms constantly modify their environment through their
metabolism, their interactions with others, and even through their death.
These changes can create feedback loops, in which organisms modify their
environment, which alters selection, which, in turn, alters phenotypes and
their effects on the environment. Here, we propose to study how endogenous
environmental change, or *niche construction* [@odling2003niche], affects
the evolution of cooperation.
