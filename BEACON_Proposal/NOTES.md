# TODO
* Incorporate feedback from Ben
* Add some detail about host-symbiont model implementation ideas
    * TODO
* Prelim result: Figure of epsilon vs no epsilon. say that we still need to learn how other params (e.g. migration) affect this and recency/primacy
* Try to get each of the criteria in there (small hints)
* Move model description up.
* Better titles for the Aims. Form as questions?
* Figure 1: Get font sizes of A and B to match
